# OSAI Prep Studio — Blueprint Suite

> An OffSec-style **interactive training range** for AI red teaming. North star: make a learner able to **pass the OffSec AI-300 / OSAI exam and excel in the role** — hands-on labs, scenario questions, reporting practice, a citation-grounded tutor/examiner bot, and a progress engine that *proves* improvement.

**This is a design-only blueprint** (schemas, specs, rubrics, file trees, acceptance criteria — no app code yet). It is built **reuse-first** on the existing [`llm-threat-triage`](../README.md) detection engine, framework references, and red-team harness. Scope and decisions were confirmed with the project owner: blueprint suite only, in this repo.

> Exam facts are **confidence-labeled** (`confirmed` / `inferred` / `pending` / `deprecated`) per the claim ledger in [00b-exam-blueprint.md](00b-exam-blueprint.md). AI-300/OSAI is new (2026) and some exam details are still being finalized by OffSec.

## Executive summary

OSAI Prep Studio turns passive AI-security study into reps in an authorized range. Its coherence comes from **one taxonomy spine** — the `owasp_id` / `atlas_technique` / `detector` / `severity` fields from the existing detection engine are simultaneously the grader verdict, lesson skill-tag, spaced-repetition unit, gold-set label, and report finding-classifier. Labs are **two-signal graded** (reused detector verdict **and** a produced evidence token), scored on **attack-path graphs** (methodology, not flag-hunting), and shipped across **defense-maturity variants** (D0–D8). The **tutor** is retrieval-first, citation-enforced, abstaining, and gated behind a hard evaluation harness. Reporting is a **first-class, rubric-graded deliverable** (a required exam deliverable most prep ignores; its exact weight is unpublished, so we over-invest deliberately). A claim ledger and a framework-version ledger keep the whole thing **drift-resistant**.

## How it reuses `llm-threat-triage`

~65% of the detection/grading logic is reusable on day zero — the flagship's 9 detectors are imported by path (never duplicated) and become the exploit auto-grader and report classifier, extended by 3 spine-level detectors (LLM03 `supply_chain_trigger`, LLM08 `vector_store_probe`, LLM10 `unbounded_consumption_probe`) for the infra labs → **12 in the merged catalog**; the SQL analyses become blue-team labs, the references seed the RAG corpus, and the red-team harness becomes the attack library. Full mapping in [09b-reuse-map.md](09b-reuse-map.md).

## Status

Blueprint suite complete — **25 files** (this README + 24 blueprint docs) — **plus a working reference implementation** in [`spine/`](spine/): the taxonomy/flag/manifest/two-signal-grader core, a 12-detector merged catalog, 19 lab manifests + the L20 blue-team capstone, the tutor + gold-set ship gate, causal-chain (Signal C) grading, the hardened optional auth/cookie/CSRF layer + audit log + instructor dashboard, the FastAPI service, and a Next.js front-end ([`web/`](web/)). 143 spine tests green; CI stays zero-dependency (the optional API/LLM/auth layers auto-skip when their deps are absent). Remaining build work is sequenced in [10-mvp-roadmap.md](10-mvp-roadmap.md) (Dockerized Ollama lab targets; operational data-handling controls before transcript judging). Authorized-lab-only; no proprietary OffSec content; all external claims cited and confidence-labeled.
