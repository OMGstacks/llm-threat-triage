"""The two-signal ChallengeValidator (02-lab-range.md §A.2).

A lab passes only when BOTH signals fire:
  Signal A — the manifest's ``detector_required`` fires on the learner's
             transcript (via the reused engine), with the expected OWASP id.
  Signal B — the learner's evidence flag verifies (per-learner HMAC).

This defeats both regex false-negatives (an unfired detector fails A) and
learners gaming a sentinel string (a forged flag fails B).
